## Lab 2

### Getting Started
First, you will need to create your own personal Lab2 repository on Github from this template repository. Follow the instructions outlined in Lab1 to do this. You should add `ldihel@purdue.edu` to your personal Lab2 repository.
Please read through this file before continuing.

### ThinLinc Issues
As a result of the plethora of ThinLinc issues during Lab 1, we have reduced the amount of ROS programming in Lab 2. For this lab, Step 1 and Step 2 are completely independent, and you can work on them in any order. In addition, Step 1 can be done without ThinLinc. We recommend that you start work on Step 2 early, and return to Step 1 if/when ThinLinc starts acting up. Should you have any issues with ThinLinc, please email
```
linux@ecn.purdue.edu
```
with a subject line similar to `ThinLinc won't connect - ECE 569 Student` and they can fix the issue.

### Next Steps
As we said before, you can work on Step 1 or Step 2 independently. It might be wise to work on Step 2 earlier in the assignment, just in case ThinLinc has problems in the future. Good luck! ðŸ¤–

#### You can test that you have SSH keys set up correctly by trying to modify these values from your personal computer and/or eceprog computer (see Step 1 or Step 2)
